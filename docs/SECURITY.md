# Security Policy

### Supported Versions
We do not provide support or later updates for outdated versions. To be protected from security gaps or bugs, only constant updating helps. Thanks to our module system, new features or changes that you don't like are easy to bypass anyway.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, simply open an issue. Use "ðŸ’£ vulnerability report: " as a prefix in the title of your issue. We'll try to patch it quickly.
